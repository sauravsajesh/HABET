# HABET

> **Nothing but consistency.**

Habet is a high-stakes, loss-aversion habit tracker designed with a "Nothing" aesthetic. It leverages the psychological pressure of simulated financial loss to enforce consistency.

## Philosophy

- **Loss Aversion**: We fear losing what we have more than we desire gaining what we don't.
- **Minimalism**: No distractions. Just you, your habit, and the stakes.
- **Tactile**: Interactions should feel heavy and deliberate.

## Tech Stack

- **Core**: HTML5, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animation**: Anime.js
- **Persistence**: LocalStorage (Privacy-first, local only)
